# Fuel Station Management System - SOLID Principles Implementation

A comprehensive C# 9 console application demonstrating all five SOLID principles through an enterprise-grade fuel station management system.

## Overview

This application manages fuel/gas station operations including:
- **Inventory Management**: Track fuel levels, stock monitoring, automated alerts
- **Sales Processing**: Handle customer transactions, multiple payment methods
- **Fuel Price Updates**: Dynamic pricing with history tracking and notifications

## SOLID Principles Implementation

### ðŸ”¸ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**"A class should have only one reason to change"**

**Location**: `SingleResponsibility/`

Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility:

- **`FuelInventoryManager`**: Only manages fuel inventory operations
- **`SalesProcessor`**: Only handles sales transaction processing
- **`PriceManager`**: Only manages fuel pricing operations

**Benefits**:
- Easy to understand and maintain
- Reduced coupling between components
- Clear separation of concerns

### ðŸ”¸ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
**"Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification"**

**Location**: `OpenClosed/`

The payment processing system demonstrates OCP:

- **`IPaymentProcessor`**: Interface that defines the contract
- **Multiple Implementations**: `CashPaymentProcessor`, `CreditCardPaymentProcessor`, `MobilePaymentProcessor`
- **`PaymentProcessorFactory`**: Allows registration of new payment methods without modifying existing code

**Benefits**:
- New payment methods can be added without changing existing code
- System is extensible and maintainable
- Follows the factory pattern for easy extension

### ðŸ”¸ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**"Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without breaking the application"**

**Location**: `LiskovSubstitution/`

All fuel dispensers are interchangeable:

- **`IFuelDispenser`**: Base interface for all dispensers
- **`StandardFuelDispenser`**: Basic fuel dispenser implementation
- **`HighVolumeDispenser`**: Enhanced dispenser with additional safety checks
- **`ElectricChargingStation`**: Electric vehicle charging station
- **`DispenserManager`**: Works with any `IFuelDispenser` implementation

**Benefits**:
- Any dispenser can be substituted without breaking functionality
- Polymorphism is properly implemented
- System is flexible and extensible

### ðŸ”¸ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**"Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use"**

**Location**: `InterfaceSegregation/`

Interfaces are segregated by functionality:

#### Inventory Interfaces:
- **`IInventoryReader`**: Read-only inventory operations
- **`IInventoryWriter`**: Write-only inventory operations

#### Sales Interfaces:
- **`ISalesProcessor`**: Sales transaction processing
- **`ISalesReporter`**: Sales reporting and analytics

**Benefits**:
- Clients depend only on methods they actually use
- Interfaces are focused and cohesive
- System is more modular and testable

### ðŸ”¸ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**"High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions"**

**Location**: `DependencyInversion/`

High-level components depend on abstractions:

#### Abstractions:
- **`INotificationService`**: Notification contract
- **`IDataRepository`**: Data persistence contract

#### Implementations:
- **Notifications**: `EmailNotificationService`, `SmsNotificationService`
- **Data Storage**: `InMemoryRepository`

#### High-Level Module:
- **`FuelStationManager`**: Depends on abstractions, not concrete implementations

**Benefits**:
- Easy to swap implementations (email â†” SMS notifications)
- Highly testable (can mock dependencies)
- Loose coupling between components
